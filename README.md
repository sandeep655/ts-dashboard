# Furniture Sales Forecasting

## Project Overview
The Furniture Sales Forecasting project is designed to predict future sales using time series analysis techniques. This project implements ARIMA and Prophet models for forecasting, integrates a Flask API for predictions, and provides an interactive Streamlit dashboard for visualization and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## Features
1. **Time Series Forecasting**:
   - Models used: ARIMA and Prophet.
   - Forecasts sales for a user-defined period with confidence intervals.

2. **Interactive Dashboard**:
   - **Home Tab**: Displays forecasted sales as a graph and a table with confidence intervals.
   - **EDA Tab**: Provides insights into the dataset with detailed visualizations using data profiling.

3. **API Integration**:
   - A Flask API serves the forecasted data to the Streamlit app.
